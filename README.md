Zipy is a compute kernel built in Rust that manages CPU, RAM, GPU, and VRAM resources for vector database operations. It decides where each operation runs and handles data movement automatically.

- 100% Rust implementation
- Manages CPU threads, RAM allocation, GPU memory, VRAM pooling
- Automatic CPU vs GPU scheduling
- Zero-copy transfers with DMA
- Works on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, Apple GPUs
- Standalone library or use with Piramid
